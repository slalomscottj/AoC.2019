# 2019 Advent of Code
## Scott Jackson

This year I've started out using this event to learn Rust.
Day01 is my very first Rust program ever.
I expect things to be pretty rough.

### Help!

In trying to learn Rust, I've run into some misunderstandings.
One is in Day03s (s for scratchpad)... as written, this program
won't compile.  But if you comment out lines 11 and 12, it does.
I have *NO* idea why.
